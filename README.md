|---|---|:-:|:-:|
| voidsprite session | .voidsn | ✔ | ✔ |
| PNG | .png | ✔ | ✔ |
| BMP | .bmp | ✔ | 〰(24-bit only) |
| TGA | .tga | ✔ | 〰(uncomp. 24-bit only) |
| JPEG XL | .jxl | ✔ | ✔ |
| Portable Bitmap, Graymap, Pixmap | .pbm .pgm .pbm | ✔ | 〰(text mode only) |
| X Bitmap | .xbm | ✔ | ✔ |
| Windows cursor | .cur | ✔ | ✔ |
| OpenRaster | .ora | ✔* | ✔* |
| Pixel Studio session | .psp | 〰* | ✔ |
| Pixel Studio (compressed) session | .psx | 〰* | ✔ |
| XYZ (RPG Maker 2000/2003) | .xyz | ✔ | ✔ |
| PBM (Cave Story engine) | .pbm | ✔ | ✔ |
| Valve Texture Format | .vtf | 〰* | ✔(v7.1, BGRA8888) |
| Aseprite Sprite | .aseprite .ase | 〰*(Frame 1 only) | ✔ |
| Piskel | .piskel | 〰 | ✔ |

\* **OpenRaster**: advanced features from painting programs like layer blend modes, etc. are not available here. Exporting the thumbnail will not work until color quantization is implemented.  
\* **Pixel Studio sessions**: a 1:1 read of this format requires accurately implementing every tool from that program. For the best experience, wipe the undo history before attempting an import (`Functions` -> `Resize canvas` -> `Resize` -> `Yes`). Animation is not supported.  
\* **VTF** - no mipmaps are imported or exported. Formats: I8, IA88, A8, RGB565,BGR888,RGB888, BGRA8888, RGBA8888, ARGB8888, ABGR8888, DXT1, DXT3, DXT5  
\* **Aseprite** - experimental. Only frame 1 is loaded. Layer blend modes and tilemaps are not available here.

### Import only

| Name | Extension | Import | Export |

\* **Java BufferedImage** - only works for small images. Larger images go beyond the size limit.  

## Installing

You can grab a pre-built binary from the latest CI artifacts: https://nightly.link/counter185/voidsprite/workflows/msbuild/main

For Windows, get the `voidsprite-build-win64.zip` file.

For Linux, get the `voidsprite-build-linux-flatpak-x86_64.zip` file; this requires [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org) to be installed. You can also try the portable binary from `voidsprite-build-linux.zip`, but this might not work on all systems.

## Building

### Windows

1. Go to `freesprite/devlibs` and extract `devlibs.7z` to the current directory (right click `devlibs.7z` > `Extract here`).
2. Go back to the repository root and run the `copy_devlibs.bat` script
3. Open `freesprite.sln` with Visual Studio and build/run like any other C++ program

### Linux

1. Install the dependencies and their respective development packages: sdl3, sdl3_ttf, sdl3_image, libpng, pugixml, zlib, liblcf, libjxl, libhwy
   * Some dependencies (libpng, pugixml, zlib, liblcf) will be automatically downloaded and built during the build step if not installed - don't worry if your distro does not package them.
   * GCC/G++ 13 or later is required
2. Install meson (note that version 0.62.2 or higher is required; Ubuntu 22.04 users will want to install a newer version directly from pip with `pip3 install --user meson`)
3. Run `./linux_build.sh`
   * You can also pass the `--run` flag to automatically run the built binary, the `--global` flag to install to `/usr/local`, and `--portable` to generate a portable build (assets stored in the same directory as the executable).
   * If you installed a separate version of GCC to use alongside your system install, you can specify a different compiler by setting the `CC` and `CXX` variables while calling `linux_build.sh`, e.g. `CC=gcc-13 CXX=g++-13 ./linux_build.sh`

By default, the generated output files will be placed in `/tmp/voidsprite`. When `--global` is passed, they will be installed to `/usr/local` instead.

#### Flatpak

You can also build the program as a Flatpak, see [Flatpak README](https://github.com/counter185/voidsprite/blob/main/freesprite/linux/flatpak/README.md).
